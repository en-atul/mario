# Mario Design System - Cursor Configuration

## Project Context
This is a React component library built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and Storybook. The design system follows a token-based architecture with comprehensive accessibility standards.

## Core Principles

### Token-First Approach
- **Never hardcode design values** - Always use tokens from `src/tokens/`
- Tokens are the single source of truth for all design decisions
- When adding new design values, create tokens first, then use them in components
- Token files: colors, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, motion

### Accessibility First
- **All interactive components must be keyboard accessible** - Full keyboard navigation support
- **ARIA attributes required** - Proper roles, labels, and state announcements
- **Focus management mandatory** - Focus trapping for modals/dialogs, proper focus restoration
- **Screen reader support** - Semantic HTML and ARIA where needed
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance** - Not optional, it's a requirement

### Component Architecture
- Use `class-variance-authority` (cva) for variant management
- Use `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for className composition
- Functional components with hooks only
- TypeScript strict typing - no `any` types
- Follow existing component patterns - consistency is key

### Compound Component Pattern
- **Use compound components when components have sub-components** - Provides better API design and namespace organization
- Example: `Modal.Header`, `Modal.Title`, `Modal.Body`, `Modal.Footer` instead of separate `ModalHeader`, `ModalTitle`, etc.
- Maintain backward compatibility by also exporting individual components
- Attach sub-components to main component: `Component.SubComponent = SubComponent`
- Use React Context when sub-components need to share state/IDs with parent

### Component Structure Pattern
Every component follows this structure:
- `component-name.tsx` - Main component implementation
- `component-name.stories.tsx` - Storybook stories
- `component-name.mdx` - Component documentation
- `index.ts` - Clean exports

### Documentation Standards
- Every component must have MDX documentation
- Include: usage examples, props table, accessibility notes
- Token documentation in `src/*.mdx` files
- Stories demonstrate all variants and states

### Testing Approach
- Storybook for component development and testing
- Visual regression testing with Chromatic
- All components must have comprehensive stories

## File Organization
- `src/components/` - All React components
- `src/tokens/` - Design token definitions
- `src/utils/` - Shared utility functions
- `src/styles/` - Global styles and CSS
- `.storybook/` - Storybook configuration
