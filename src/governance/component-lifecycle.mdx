- Get approval before starting

### 2. In Development
**Status:** Being built

- Component implementation in progress
- Stories being written
- Documentation being created
- Accessibility being verified

**What to do:**
- Follow component structure pattern
- Create comprehensive stories
- Write complete documentation
- Ensure WCAG compliance

### 3. Review
**Status:** Undergoing review process

- Design review pending
- Accessibility audit ongoing
- Documentation review

**What to do:**
- Address review feedback
- Make necessary changes
- Respond to questions
- Update as needed

### 4. Stable
**Status:** Released and maintained

- Component is production-ready
- Fully documented
- Accessibility verified
- Part of the design system

**What to do:**
- Maintain component
- Fix bugs promptly
- Update as design system evolves
- Keep documentation current

### 5. Deprecated
**Status:** Marked for removal

- Component still works but not recommended
- Migration path provided
- Will be removed in future version
- Alternative component available

**What to do:**
- Use alternative component
- Follow migration guide

### 6. Removed
**Status:** No longer available

- Component has been removed
- Breaking change in major version
- Migration required

**What to do:**
- Migrate to replacement component
- Update all usages
- Remove old imports

## Deprecation Process

### When to Deprecate

Components may be deprecated when:
- Better alternative exists
- Design pattern changes
- Component doesn't meet new standards
- Usage is low and maintenance cost is high

### Deprecation Timeline

1. **Announcement** - Component marked as deprecated
2. **Migration Guide** - Documentation for moving to alternative
3. **Support Period** - Component remains functional
4. **Removal** - Removed in next major version

### Example Deprecation Notice

```tsx
/**
 * @deprecated Use `NewComponent` instead. This component will be removed in v2.0.0
 * @see {@link NewComponent} for migration guide
 */
export const OldComponent = () => {
  // ...
};
```
