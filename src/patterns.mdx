<Title>Patterns & Guidelines</Title>

This section provides common UI patterns, best practices, and guidelines for using the Mario Design System effectively.

## What are Patterns?

Patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems. They show how to combine components, handle interactions, and structure layouts to create consistent, accessible user experiences.

## Pattern Categories

- **Form Patterns** - Common form layouts and validation patterns
- **Layout Patterns** - Page structures and component arrangements
- **Interaction Patterns** - User flows and interaction patterns
- **Feedback Patterns** - Error handling, loading states, and notifications

## Guidelines

### Do's ✅

- **Use design tokens** - Always reference tokens instead of hardcoded values
- **Follow accessibility standards** - All patterns must be keyboard accessible
- **Maintain consistency** - Use established patterns for similar use cases
- **Test with real content** - Patterns should work with actual content lengths
- **Consider mobile** - Ensure patterns work across all screen sizes

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't skip accessibility** - Every pattern must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- **Don't mix patterns** - Stick to one pattern per use case
- **Don't override tokens** - Use tokens as-is or extend them properly
- **Don't ignore edge cases** - Handle empty states, errors, and loading states
- **Don't break keyboard navigation** - Maintain focus management
