Tabs organize content into multiple panels that users can switch between. Only one tab panel is visible at a time.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Usage

Provide an array of tab items with `value`, `label`, and `content`. Use `defaultValue` to set the initially active tab.

## Disabled Tabs

Set `disabled={true}` on tab items to prevent interaction. Disabled tabs are visually distinct and non-clickable.

## Accessibility

Tabs include proper ARIA attributes for screen readers. The active tab is clearly indicated with visual styling.
