Buttons are interactive elements that trigger actions when clicked. They provide clear visual feedback and support multiple variants and sizes for different use cases.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Variants

Buttons come in three visual variants:

- **primary**: Primary action buttons with brand color background. Use for the main action on a page or form.
- **secondary**: Secondary actions with white background and border. Use for less prominent actions.
- **destructive**: Destructive actions with red background. Use for dangerous actions like delete or remove.

## Sizes

Available sizes: `small`, `medium`, `large`

Choose the size based on the importance and context of the action. Medium is the default size.

## States

- **default**: Normal interactive state
- **hover**: Visual feedback on hover
- **active**: Pressed state
- **disabled**: Non-interactive state with reduced opacity

## Usage

Buttons accept all standard HTML button props. Use semantic HTML and provide accessible labels.
