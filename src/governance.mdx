<Title>Design System Governance</Title>

Governance defines how the design system is maintained, evolved, and contributed to. This section outlines the processes, standards, and guidelines for managing the Mario Design System.

## Core Principles

### Consistency First
- All contributions must maintain design system consistency
- New components should follow established patterns
- Breaking changes require careful consideration and migration plans

### Accessibility Non-Negotiable
- All components must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Accessibility reviews are mandatory before merging
- No exceptions for "quick fixes" that compromise accessibility

### Token-Based Architecture
- Design decisions must use design tokens
- New design values require token creation first
- No hardcoded values in components

## Contribution Process

### 1. Proposing Changes

**For New Components:**
1. Create an issue describing the component and use case
2. Get approval before starting implementation
3. Follow the component structure pattern
4. Include comprehensive stories and documentation
5. Ensure WCAG compliance

**For Component Updates:**
1. Document the proposed change and rationale
2. Consider backward compatibility
3. Update all relevant documentation
4. Test across all variants and states

**For Token Changes:**
1. Assess impact on existing components
2. Create migration plan if breaking change
3. Update all affected components
4. Document the change in token documentation

### 2. Review Process

All contributions go through:
- **Code Review** - Technical implementation review
- **Design Review** - Visual and UX consistency check
- **Accessibility Review** - A11y compliance verification
- **Documentation Review** - Completeness and clarity check

### 3. Approval Criteria

Before merging, contributions must:
- ✅ Pass all automated tests
- ✅ Meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- ✅ Include comprehensive Storybook stories
- ✅ Have complete MDX documentation
- ✅ Follow established code patterns
- ✅ Use design tokens appropriately
- ✅ Have no breaking changes (or approved migration plan)

## Component Lifecycle

### Stages

1. **Proposed** - Component idea documented and approved
2. **In Development** - Component being built
3. **Review** - Undergoing review process
4. **Stable** - Released and maintained
5. **Deprecated** - Marked for removal, migration path provided
6. **Removed** - No longer available

### Deprecation Policy

- Components are deprecated with at least one major version notice
- Migration guides provided for deprecated components
- Deprecated components remain functional until removal
- Breaking changes require major version bump

## Versioning Strategy

The design system follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer). See the [Versioning](/docs/governance-versioning--docs) section for detailed information on:

- Semantic versioning principles
- Breaking changes policy
- Release process
- Changelog format
- Migration guides

## Decision-Making

### Design Decisions
- Design tokens: Requires design system team approval
- New components: Requires use case validation
- Breaking changes: Requires team consensus

### Technical Decisions
- Architecture changes: Team discussion and approval
- Dependency updates: Security and compatibility review
- Performance optimizations: Benchmarking required

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly** - Review and merge contributions
- **Monthly** - Dependency updates and security patches
- **Quarterly** - Design system audit and improvements
- **Annually** - Major version planning and roadmap

### Quality Standards
- All components must have 100% Storybook coverage
- Accessibility testing required for all interactive components
- Visual regression testing via Chromatic
- Documentation must be complete and up-to-date

## Code of Conduct

### For Contributors
- Be respectful and constructive in reviews
- Provide clear, actionable feedback
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Document decisions and rationale
- Prioritize accessibility and user experience

### For Maintainers
- Respond to contributions in a timely manner
- Provide clear guidance and feedback
- Maintain consistency across the system
- Keep documentation current
- Make decisions transparently

## Getting Help

- **Questions?** - Open a discussion issue
- **Found a bug?** - Create a bug report with reproduction steps
- **Have an idea?** - Propose it in a feature request
- **Need clarification?** - Check documentation or ask in discussions
